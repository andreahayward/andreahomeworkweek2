Andrea Hayward Homework Week 2 Refactoring

## The Assignment
Our homework assignment this week was to refactor an existing index.html file with the appropriate CSS as well as images. We were expected to check for formatting, how the overall page looked, and any redundant code or code that could be cleaned up.

## Work I Did/Updates Made
I first created a new repository for this homework assignment. I then saved the index.html file, CSS style sheet, and all images to a local folder. In VS Code, I linked the HTML page with the CSS style sheet and linked the images to their appropriate content. I updated the file so that the background image became visible as opposed to linking it to an "img src=". In the HTML file I added an ID tag to link the "Search Engine Optimization" button on the top right of the webpage with the "Search Enging Optimization" field on the bottom of the webpage. I also consolidated the formatting of the margins and color for .benefit-lead, brand, and cost (on the CSS file). I also added Alt Tags for all images.
